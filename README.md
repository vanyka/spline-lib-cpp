# [C++ Header-Only Spline Library](https://github.com/vanyka/splines-lib-cpp)
This Library calculates different types of splines(Linear, Catmull Rom, Bezier) based on the given support points.


## Features
- For Catmull-Rom splines there is a setting by which you can set your spline to pass all your given points or if it is unset then the first and last given point is a control point only (curve does not passes through).
- With EvenDistributedSplineAdapter you can transform any Spline into an Even Distributed Spline.
