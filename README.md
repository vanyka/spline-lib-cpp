# [C++ Header-Only Spline Library](https://github.com/vanyka/spline-lib-cpp)
A header-only C++ library that provides a variety of splines for curve interpolation, such as Catmull-Rom, and Bezier splines.

## Features
- Easy to use interface for using splines.
- Implementation for Catmull-Rom and Bezier splines is included.
- New spline types can be easily implemented by deriving the `Spline` interface.
- templated implementation for using your already used Vector implementation. (An example implementation is provided in `example/vector2.h`)
- Both using splines as a Functor for interpolating over or generating points with a given resolution is supported.
- An adapter for even distributed splines is provided by `EvenDistributedSplineAdapter` class.

## Code examples
### Creating a Catmull-Rom spline
```cpp
#include "spline.h"
#include "catmull_rom.h"
#include "vector2.h"

int main() {
    Spline<Vector2f>* spline = new CatmullRomSpline<Vector2f>();
    spline->AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(0.f, 0.f));
    spline->AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(1.f, .5f));
    spline->AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(2.f, .2f));
    spline->AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(1.f, .3f));

    // Generating Points over the spline
    std::vector<Vector2f> points = spline->GeneratePoints(100);

    // Interpolating over spline using the functor
    // Note: the interpolation value must be between 0 and 1
    Vector2f spline_center = *spline(0.5);
    
    delete spline;
}
```
### Using the `EvenDistributedSplineAdapter` class
```cpp
#include "catmull_rom.h"
#include "even_distribiuted_spline_adapter.h"
#include "vector2.h"

int main() {
    CatmullRomSpline<Vector2f> spline;
    spline.AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(0.f, 0.f));
    spline.AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(1.f, .5f));
    spline.AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(2.f, .2f));
    spline.AddSupportPoint(Vector2f(1.f, .3f));

    auto even_spline = EvenDistributedSplineAdapter(spline).GeneratePoints(100);

    // Generating Points over the even spline
    std::vector<Vector2f> points = even_spline.GeneratePoints(100);

    // Interpolating over even spline using the functor
    // Note: the interpolation value is now a distance from the start of the spline
    Vector2f point1 = even_spline(0.7f);
    Vector2f point2 = even_spline(1.4f);
}
```

## Setup the Example project
You will need to have the following installed:
- CMake (3.10 or newer)

### Windows
By executing `scripts/default.bat` file, the detected IDE project will be generated by CMake.

### Other OS

Generate it by using the following command at the root directory:
```bash
cmake -B build
```
